        Yunisle is a gentle space for people who are tired of being only <em>the expected one</em>,  
        and who are ready to become a more honest, awake, and self-created presence.

      <p class="tagline">
        Through developmental psychology, intensive longitudinal thinking, and human warmth,  
        we explore how to live more freely, feel more deeply, and rebuild our relationship  
        with self, others, and time.

        <p>What happens when you are no longer only living for others’ expectations?</p>
        <p>What if your anxiety, numbness, and overthinking are invitations, not defects?</p>
        <p>What becomes possible when your inner world is seen with clarity and compassion?</p>

      <h2>What this place is for</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a journey from “the expected person” to “the self-awakening being”.  
        We use psychology as method and philosophy as spine to support a path from  
        experience → awareness → action → self-creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we work to rebuild how you meet yourself, others, and time — not as a performance,  
        but as a living, breathing relationship.
      </p>

            Inside, you feel anxious, disconnected, or like you are living a script that is not yours.

          <div class="item-title">You swing between over-control and collapse.</div>

            Sometimes you are hyper-responsible; sometimes you feel frozen, numb, or exhausted by expectations.

            You sense there is a version of you that is freer, warmer, more grounded —  
            but you don’t want quick fixes or empty slogans.

        If this speaks to you, you are already standing at the shore of your own inner isle.  
        Yunisle is an invitation to walk a little further in.

      <h2>What we can build together</h2>
      <p>
        Through research, writing, workshops, and counselling-inspired spaces,  
        I walk with people as they:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>name their experience with more truth and less judgment,</li>
        <li>see the patterns that quietly shape their days,</li>
        <li>experiment with new ways of relating to self and others,</li>
        <li>and slowly create a life that fits like skin, not armor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are welcome here — with your questions, your contradictions, your half-finished stories.  
        Every step carries a story, echoing forward, shaping the soul of the journey.
